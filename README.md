# Gen-Z-Translator
## Introduction
This app is more than just a fun translator; it reflects my passion for bridging generational gaps in communication. It helps make slang more understandable in a lighthearted yet educational way. This project examines how Gen Z language reflects identity, culture, and digital life. By analyzing evolving slang within online communities, I explore how language functions as social data—shaping belonging, expression, and meaning in a rapidly changing world I actively inhabit.”
